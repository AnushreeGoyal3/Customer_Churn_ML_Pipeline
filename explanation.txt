🧠 MODEL INTERPRETATION (THIS IS WHAT INTERVIEWERS ASK)
✅ ROC-AUC = 0.833

Very solid for churn prediction

Means the model ranks churners above non-churners 83% of the time

Anything >0.80 is considered production-viable baseline

🔍 Confusion Matrix Breakdown
[[724 309]   → Non-churners
 [ 76 298]]  → Churners

Interpretation	Value
True Positives (caught churners)	298
False Negatives (missed churners)	76
Recall (Churn = 1)	80%
Precision (Churn = 1)	49%

👉 Key Insight:
Your model is aggressively catching churners (high recall), but with more false alarms (lower precision).

💡 This is DESIRABLE in churn use-cases:

Missing a churner = revenue loss

False positive = marketing email (cheap)

🎯 HOW TO EXPLAIN THIS IN AN INTERVIEW (MEMORIZE)

“We optimized for recall on the churn class since the business cost of missing a churner is significantly higher than a false positive. ROC-AUC was used as the primary metric due to class imbalance.”


STEP 7 — Upgrade Model: Random Forest (Strong Baseline Boost)
🎯 Goal

Train a Random Forest

Compare against Logistic Regression

Extract feature importance (very interview-friendly)

7.1 Why Random Forest (what to say in interviews)

“Random Forest captures nonlinear interactions and feature thresholds that linear models can’t, while remaining interpretable and robust to noisy features.”



“We used SHAP values to explain individual and global feature contributions. Contract type, tenure, and monthly charges were the strongest churn drivers, aligning with domain intuition.”
